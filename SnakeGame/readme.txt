CIT 190 - Final Project_Snake Game
The snake game will use html 5 canvas and javascript to creat the game snake
which I rmemeber mainly from my old nokia cell phone.  

**Game Play**

When the game starts the user will use the arrow keys to control the direction 
of the snake around the game board.  There will be apples that pop up in random 
positions around the board and the user will attemt to have their snake eat the 
apples.  Each time the user eats the apple the snake will get longer by one section.
If the user runs into the side of the board or into the snakes trailing body, the game 
will be over.
The goal is to see how long you can make your snake before colliding with the 
wall or the snake itself.

***Progress***
This game is in its early stages.  I have the head of the snake created and have connected
the movement to the arrow keys on the keyboard.
 
 ***To Do***

 *create collision detection for the edges of the board as well as the snake body

 *Generate 'apples' on the game board in random postions.

 *Allow the snake to grow with each apple consumed.

 *Show a score for the palyer to guage how well they did.

 *Add sound for collision with the gameboard, apples and the snakes body.
